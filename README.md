# Folder Project with Adapter Pattern

This is a sample project that showcases a folder structure for a Node.js application using the Adapter design pattern. The Adapter pattern is used to convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect, allowing incompatible classes to work together.

## Description

This project aims to demonstrate a basic implementation of using the Adapter pattern in a Node.js application to work with different databases. The project includes a user model (`userModel.js`), a user service (`userService.js`), and adapters for MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL databases (`mongoAdapter.js`, `mysqlAdapter.js`, and `postgresAdapter.js` respectively).

## Main Components

- **User Model (`userModel.js`):** Defines the structure and schema of user data and provides functions for performing operations in the database related to users.

- **User Service (`userService.js`):** Uses the Adapter pattern to interact with the database adapters and provides functions for performing user-related operations.

- **Database Adapters:** The adapters (`mongoAdapter.js`, `mysqlAdapter.js`, `postgresAdapter.js`) act as intermediaries between the application and specific databases. Each adapter implements a common interface to handle specific operations in its respective database.

## Installation and Execution

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/adapter-pattern.git`

2. Install dependencies: `npm install`

3. Configure environment variables in the `.env` file with the connection information for the corresponding databases (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL).

4. Run the application: `npm start`

## Folder Structure

- `src`: Contains the source code of the application.

  - `adapters`: Contains the adapters used to interact with different databases.

    - `dbAdapters`: Contains the specific adapters for each database (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL).

  - `models`: Contains the `userModel.js`, which defines the structure and schema of user data.

  - `services`: Contains the `userService.js`, which uses the Adapter pattern to interact with the database adapters.

  - `utils`: Contains the `logger.js`, which configures and creates a logging system in the application.

  - `app.js`: Application configuration file.

  - `index.js`: Main file that starts the application.

- `tests`: Contains unit tests for the model and service.

- `config`: Contains the `dbConfig.json`, which stores the connection information for the different databases.

- `.env`: File containing environment variables for application configuration.

- `.gitignore`: File specifying which files and folders to ignore in version control.

- `package.json`: Node.js configuration file containing dependencies and commands for project management.
